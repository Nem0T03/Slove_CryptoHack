This part provides a tip that the bytes.fromhex() function can be used to convert hex to bytes. The .hex() instance method can be called on byte strings to get the hex representation. However, I don't need this tip because I have a library that includes from binascii import unhexlify.
Here is a code example:
from binascii import unhexlify

flag = unhexlify(b'63727970746f7b596f755f77696c6c5f62655f776f726b696e675f776974685f6865785f737472696e67735f615f6c6f747d')
print(flag)

And the answer is : b'crypto{You_will_be_working_with_hex_strings_a_lot}'

* from binascii import unhexlify
is an import statement in Python. Here’s a detailed explanation of each part:

from binascii:

This part indicates that you are importing something from the binascii module. The binascii module contains various methods to convert between binary and ASCII.
import unhexlify:

This part specifies what you are importing from the binascii module, which in this case is the unhexlify function.
What is unhexlify?
The unhexlify function is used to convert a string of hexadecimal digits into a binary string (bytes object). Essentially, it takes a string representation of hexadecimal data and converts it back into its original byte form.

Example of unhexlify in Use
Here’s an example to illustrate how unhexlify works:

example: 

from binascii import unhexlify

hex_string = "48656c6c6f20576f726c64"  # Hexadecimal representation of "Hello World"
bytes_data = unhexlify(hex_string)

print(bytes_data)  # Output will be: b'Hello World'
In this example:

The string "48656c6c6f20576f726c64" is a hexadecimal representation of the ASCII string "Hello World".
The unhexlify function converts this hex string back to the bytes representation of "Hello World".
The print function then outputs b'Hello World', where the b prefix indicates that this is a bytes object.
