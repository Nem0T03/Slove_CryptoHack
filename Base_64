Before we go to this part, we need to understand what Base64 is. Base64 is another common encoding scheme, which allows us to represent binary data as an ASCII string using an alphabet of 64 characters. One character of a Base64 string encodes 6 binary digits (bits), and so 4 characters of Base64 encode three 8-bit bytes.

Base64 is most commonly used online, so binary data such as images can be easily included in HTML or CSS files.

Now, let's go to the lesson:

This part contains an ASCII string, and we need to revert it:

Code example:

import base64
from binascii import unhexlify

flag = unhexlify(b'72bca9b68fc16ac7beeb8f849dca1d8a783e8acf9679bf9269f7bf')
flag1 = base64.b64encode(flag)
print(flag1)


And the result:
b'crypto/Base+64+Encoding+is+Web+Safe/'
