When I see this theory, I think of discrete math. Despite not having attended university, I learn knowledge from books and the internet, and I am happy to read and understand this. So, I won't write too much about this.

Exercise:

Given the string label:

given = "label"

print("crypto{", end="")
for x in given:
    print(chr(ord(x)^13), end="")
print("}")
XOR each character with the integer 13. Convert these integers back to a string and submit the flag as crypto{new_string}.

Result: crypto{aloha}
